# Subscription Renewal Approval System

## Overview
Implemented explicit user approval system for subscription renewals with time-bound, single-use approvals.

## Features

### 1. Approval Structure
```rust
pub struct RenewalApproval {
    pub sub_id: u64,           // Subscription identifier
    pub max_spend: i128,       // Maximum spend limit
    pub expires_at: u32,       // Expiration ledger number
    pub used: bool,            // Single-use flag
}
```

### 2. Core Functions

#### `approve_renewal()`
- Creates a new approval for a subscription
- Requires subscription owner authentication
- Emits `ApprovalCreated` event

#### `consume_approval()`
- Validates approval before renewal
- Checks: existence, expiration, usage, amount limit
- Marks approval as used (non-reusable)
- Emits `ApprovalRejected` event on failure

### 3. Validation Rules

| Check | Rejection Reason Code |
|-------|----------------------|
| Approval not found | 4 |
| Already used | 2 |
| Expired | 1 |
| Amount exceeds max_spend | 3 |

### 4. Renewal Flow
1. User calls `approve_renewal()` with subscription ID, approval ID, max spend, and expiration
2. System stores approval bound to subscription
3. When renewal is triggered, `renew()` requires approval ID and amount
4. System validates and consumes approval
5. If valid, renewal proceeds; otherwise reverts with "Invalid or expired approval"

### 5. Events

- `ApprovalCreated`: Emitted when approval is created
- `ApprovalRejected`: Emitted when validation fails (includes reason code)
- `RenewalSuccess`: Emitted on successful renewal
- `RenewalFailed`: Emitted on failed renewal attempt

## Security Features

✅ **Auto-expiration**: Approvals expire at specified ledger number
✅ **Non-reusable**: Single-use only, marked as used after consumption
✅ **Amount-bound**: Renewal amount cannot exceed max_spend
✅ **Owner-only**: Only subscription owner can create approvals
✅ **Revert on invalid**: All renewals without valid approval are reverted

## Testing

All 19 tests passing:
- Approval creation and usage
- Expiration enforcement
- Non-reusability
- Amount limit validation
- Multiple approvals per subscription
- Integration with existing renewal logic

## Build Status

✅ Unit tests: 19/19 passed
